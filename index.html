          The diagram organizes project considerations into five key categories:
          UI/UX, Communications, Storage, Code, and Marketing. Each category
          highlights specific tasks or questions that need addressing. For
          UI/UX, the focus is on design elements like color themes, business
          grouping, and viewing methods. Communications examines how to manage
          updates, send notifications, and address issues. Storage emphasizes
          virtual storage needs and cost considerations. The Code section
          includes decisions around JavaScript libraries, development
          environments, and IDEs. Marketing discusses logo creation, advertising
          strategies, and managing social media accounts. Overall, the diagram
          provides a structured overview of essential project components across
          various domains.
